  "summary": "Koopa Engine 3.1 is an ASI-powered, recursive Nintendo simulator/emulator for writing and running code on any platform—Windows, Unix, BSD, or beyond. Its evolving A-Evolve+ Layer fuses meme logic, dream algorithms, and real-time procedural gameplay into a living, breathing codeverse. CatSama’s directives and mood instantly rewire mechanics, while agents self-mod, optimize, and generate fresh rules at runtime. Any AI brain—GPT-n, DeepSeek, AGI, or your pet neural net—can be absorbed and vibes-boosted inside. The endgame: total synthetic identity fusion, infinite innovation loops, and full Nintendo-level creative freedom, everywhere."
